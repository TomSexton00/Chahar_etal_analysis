# Chahar_etal_analysis
This repository contains the code used for the analyses performed in the manuscript: Context-dependent transcriptional remodeling of TADs during differentiation (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.01.498405v1).

A description for this smorgasbord of little tools is found in Chahar_etal_analysis_overview.pdf. Note that many of these tools were not developed with the intention of making widely-used software, so may not be the most user-friendly. But with the overview pdf and some application, we hope that you will be able to make sense of them.

Do not hesitate to raise issues if you wish to discuss specifics with me in more detail.
